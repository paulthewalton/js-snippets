# JS Utils

> Simple, easy to understand (hopefully!) Vanilla JS utils. Written in ES6 syntax but API compatible down to IE 10.

---

## Guidelines

These utility & helper functions should:

- be small and relatively simple, hopefully easy to understand and read through
- not have any dependancies, although may be tailored for use with certain frameworks or applications
- be API compatible with a wide array of browsers (see browserlist in `package.json`)

## Dev

- linting with ESLint (`npm run lint` or `npm run dev` to start watcher)
- testing with Jest (`npm run test`)
